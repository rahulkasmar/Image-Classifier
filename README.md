# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Classification

This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for image classification tasks. CNNs are a cornerstone of deep learning and computer vision, leveraging hierarchical feature extraction to process structured data such as images.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known benchmark in the field of computer vision, comprising 60,000 color images evenly distributed across 10 mutually exclusive classes such as airplanes, cars, birds, and cats. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, with no overlap between the classes. The model aims to accurately distinguish these categories by learning intricate patterns in the image data.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive preprocessing pipeline, including data normalization and augmentation, to enhance model robustness and mitigate overfitting.
- Custom CNN architecture developed using TensorFlow/Keras, incorporating convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers for effective feature extraction and classification.
- Model evaluation based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization of training dynamics, including loss and accuracy trends across epochs.

## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset contains:
- **Total images**: 60,000 (50,000 training and 10,000 testing).
- **Number of classes**: 10 (e.g., airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck).
- **Resolution**: 32x32 color images.

You can download the dataset from [CIFAR-10 Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
